# Katsunari Shishido

I am Katsunari shishido who is a second year Ph.D student in Graduate School of Engineering at Osaka University.
I am adviced by [Atsuko Miyaji](https://cy2sec.comm.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp/miyaji-lab/member/miyaji.html). I am interested in cryptographic protocol. Especially, I am working on secure protocols such as the private set intersection protocol and the secure two-party comparison protocol.
